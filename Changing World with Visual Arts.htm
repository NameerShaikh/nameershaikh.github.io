 <h3>Ravi Varma belonged to the princely state of Travancore in Kerala. He was trained in the European techniques of oil painting and realistic life study.<br> <br> Raja Ravi Varma was amongst the first painters to fuse Indian tradition with European art. He painted scenes from Indian mythology, using western<br> <br> techniques of shading and realism.

By the 1880s, Raja Ravi Varma set up his own printing press and picture production team. Copies of his paintings<br> <br> were printed in large numbers and became easily affordable.
Abanindranath Tagore, the nephew of Rabindranath Tagore, and other artists belonging<br> <br>  to his group criticized and labeled Raja Ravi Varma’s paintings as too westernized and imitative. These artists drew inspiration from the ancient mural<br> <br> paintings of the Ajanta and the miniature paintings of medieval India.

The Banished Yaksha of Kalidas’s poem Meghaduta, painted by Abanindranath<br> <br>  Tagore, is an example of the use of Japanese water colour landscapes in Indian art.

After the 1920s, many artists abandoned the painting style<br> <br> popularized by Abanindranath Tagore. The new artists started painting on real life themes rather than ancient art forms like tribal designs and folk art.
